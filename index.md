Hi I'm James

This will be my blog about my Fantasy Baseball Teams for the 2024 season. I'm keeping this blog for my enjoyment, as well as a means of tracking the teams's success throughout the season and having a clearly laid-out thought process that I can look back on in the offseason. In March I will lay the foundation by providing insight into the players on each of my teams. Then each month I will update the blog providing my place in the standings, analysis of moves made and how my players are doing in each of the many leagues I am taking part in. 

It is also a little github project for me to try out making a blog on here and learning about how some of this repo stuff works.
